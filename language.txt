## Rule Language.

This is the core specification of the Incident Report Handling, and it's used inside the rules.xml file, the main idea of LV0 is to process the incident Report queue
and automatize some aspects, this is the most important (and not developed) part of the tools, as this should be a rich language and currenty it's only a very basic 
schema.

Current commands:

take --> take the ticket
next_action -> finish the processing of the rule, continue
reject--> reject the ticket
end_actions -> finish the processing of the rule, dont' process more rules




cmd.yp --> external parser
	--> use Actions: for implementing low level access to RTIR
		-->use the RT::Client::REST

	--> command process 
			--> Loop as other commands
			--> for all the tickets
				--> process_ticket (RT)
			-	-->process ticket ---> parser the rule
				-->IHL
